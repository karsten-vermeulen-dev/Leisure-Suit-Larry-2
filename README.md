# Leisure Suit Larry 2

I'm going to attempt to re-create the Sierra SCI engine such that I can feed it the original scripts. Notice the word _attempt_. All the original game logic exists in the scripts. The only thing I don't have access to is the image data. For that, I will simply use screenshots of the game screens.
